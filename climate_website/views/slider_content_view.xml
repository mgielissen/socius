                                                Crocodile bones, 50 million years old, have shown up on the Arctic island of Ellesmere, and that’s a problem.
                                                Scientists have been unable to explain how the Arctic could have warmed up enough to host those tropical creatures.

                                                Given that they are so insubstantial—all the moisture that constitutes clouds planetwide at any given moment would amount to
                                                no more than a micro-thin film of water if spread out over Earth’s surface—clouds have an outsized impact on our climate.

                                                  They cool Earth's surface by reflecting much of the Sun’s energy back into space. They warm like blankets by preventing the
                                                  planet from radiating away all of the heat it absorbs each day. And of course, they are key components of the water cycle,
                                                  storing water that has evaporated from the oceans and other bodies and then returning it as rain and snow.
